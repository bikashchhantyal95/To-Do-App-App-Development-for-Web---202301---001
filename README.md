# To-Do-App-App-Development-for-Web---202301---001
This is the assignment for App development for Web. This is a Todo App.
# Student Name: Bikash Chhantyal

I have created a create form in different page which can be accessed through link in menu name "Add Todo". 
But later on I created form on the index page. Todo can be added from both ways.
I had some issue at first while adding form in index thats why I created form on different page.
Now the issue is resolved but I did not remove the menu link for page to create todo.

# The todo can be added from the todo form on the index page or by clicking on the Add Todo Link on menu.
# The todo item whose status is not done will show a check box.
# When the checkbox is clicked the todo status will be updated to done. And completion date is also shown when status changes.
